We have created the project for webcam use. We have done so using the explicit multiplication of our desired points with the K[R t]
matrix. We draw the coordinate axes and a cube on the checkerboard. The drawn cube can be moved by tilting the checkerboard.
Further explanations of our work and our created functions can be found in the Assignment1.h file.
